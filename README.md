# Mycraft

Mycraft is a simple [Minecraft][] clone written in Java, using [LWJGL][]. It is
my final summative project for the ICS2O course.

[Minecraft]: http://minecraft.net
[LWJGL]: http://lwjgl.org

## Building

Mycraft is developed using [NetBeans][]. Before building Mycraft, go to the
properties window of the project, click the **Run** node, and in the VM Options,
change the last item of the LWJGL directory path to  your operating system
(`windows`, `macosx`, or `linux`).
